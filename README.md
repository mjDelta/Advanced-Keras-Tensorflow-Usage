# Advanced-Keras-Usage
Some advanced keras usage, like self-defined layer...</br>
1.<a href="https://github.com/mjDelta/Advanced-Keras-Usage/blob/master/self_defined_layer.py">self-defined layer</a></br>
Self-defined Layer by `keras.layers.core.Lambda` or `keras.engine.topology.Layer`.</br>
2.<a href="https://github.com/mjDelta/Advanced-Keras-Usage/blob/master/seq_to_seq_addition.py">seq_to_seq_addition</a></br>
Use the `many-to-many` structure in RNN to complete the addition of two numbers. Encode numbers in a new encoding way, and use the seq_to_seq model to solve it.</br>
